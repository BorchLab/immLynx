Description: A comprehensive toolkit that bridges popular Python-based immune
    repertoire analysis tools and Hugging Face protein language models into the
    R environment. Provides unified interfaces for TCR distance calculations
    (tcrdist3), sequence generation probability (OLGA), selection inference
    (soNNia), clustering (clusTCR), deep learning features (DeepTCR), protein
    embeddings (ESM-2), metaclone discovery (metaclonotypist), and specificity
    group identification (GLIPH2). Fully compatible with the scRepertoire and
    immApex ecosystem for single-cell immune repertoire analysis.
